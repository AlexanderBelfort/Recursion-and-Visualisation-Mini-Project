INTRODUCTION



In this assessment you will be using a number of techniques and skills that you have learnt so far,
and you will also be encouraged to use third party libraries or source code to achieve the required tasks.

BACKGROUND



In this assessment you will use turtle graphics in Python: 
https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle 
There are many tutorials on the Python Turtle package, so feel free to search online. 
The following tutorials may be useful:

SPECIFIC TASKS



You are asked to visualise the solving process of the Hanoi Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) with additional functionalities. 
The following program is given (note it is written in Python 2): 
https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Demo/turtle/tdemo_minimal_hanoi.py 
You can build your program based on the above code, and you can also develop your own code.

REQUIREMENTS



1. In the header of the main window display your student ID and name. (1 mark) 
2. For each of the discs show how many times they have been moved, the number should always be adjacent to the disc and move with the disc. (1 mark) 
3. Show the total number of moves for all discs so far at the bottom of the screen after each movement. (1 mark) 
4. A user can change the number of discs (up to 10) through a dialog box before the simulation starts, and the colours of the discs should be all different. (1 mark) 
5. All discs have different speeds according to their weight: heavier (bigger) ones have slower speed. (1 mark) 
6. Press the "p" key to pause the simulation for 3 seconds; press the "q" key to quit the program at any time. (1 mark) 
7. Calculate the current progress in terms of moves remaining and add a progress bar to display the progress of the simulation and update the progress bar after each movement. (1 mark) 
8. Add a non-recursive algorithm in your code to complete the same Hanoi Tower problem. A user should be given a choice to run different algorithms through a dialog box before the simulation starts. Please structure your code well so that the new algorithm does not mess up the existing one. (1.5 marks)
